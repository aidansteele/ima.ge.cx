# [ima.ge.cx](https://ima.ge.cx)

This repository contains the frontend of the ima.ge.cx website. It uses Next.js
and Mantine. I chose these because they seemed like the easiest and most popular
choice at the time. I have no idea if either of those assumptions are true and
I am happy for contributors to re-write as they see fit.
